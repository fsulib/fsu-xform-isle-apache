Patches and additional files required to break the monolith are in the transformations directory, which preserves the directory structure of isle-apache.

The config directory contains the contents of Isle's config/apache directory. I'm not certain whether anything other than 'settings.production.php' is useful. 'php.production.ini' could prove so.
